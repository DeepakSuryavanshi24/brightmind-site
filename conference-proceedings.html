    <h2>Greetings from Springer!</h2>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in publishing with Springer. Please find attached the proposal form along with other detailed information that will be required for the formal evaluation of the Conference Proceedings.</p>

    <h3>General Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We publish all conference proceedings as book volumes, and our current proceedings programme is focused on highly niche conferences.</li>
      <li>If you wish to publish your proceedings, please send us the duly filled in proposal form (attached here), along with the complete CVs of the volume editors. Please note that the volume editors should be known experts and recognized names in their respective fields. We usually recommend a maximum of 3 editors for each volume, out of which not more than one should be from the host institute.</li>
      <li>Please share the details of your review process: 
        <ul>
          <li>What kind of review policy are you going to follow?</li>
          <li>The names of reviewers (along with their affiliations) who have agreed to review the articles.</li>
          <li>Have you prepared any review questionnaire?</li>
          <li>What steps are you going to take to check plagiarism?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Important Information:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Publication with Springer is free of cost.</li>
      <li>Cost is incurred only if you wish to buy the proceedings (hard copy/e-Book), which is not mandatory at all.</li>
      <li>Abstracts/extended abstracts and short papers (less than 4 pages) are not considered for publication.</li>
      <li>The Springer editorial team reserves the final right to accept or reject a paper on the basis of plagiarism checks and review reports.</li>
      <li>We may ask you to submit the review reports of all the accepted papers at the time of manuscript submission. Please make sure to save those reports during the review process at your end.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once we receive all relevant information, we will evaluate the same and let you know of the publishing possibilities.</p>
